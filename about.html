        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey, Iâ€™m Krishna Gopal Kar ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at KIIT (4th year). Iâ€™m really
            into coding and exploring new tech â€” AI is Fun, but I also enjoy backend development and building things
            that actually solve problems.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Over time, Iâ€™ve worked with Java, Python, C, C#, MySQL, Oracle, SQLServer, and a bit of MongoDB. Right now, Iâ€™m learning
            Spring Boot and backend systems, while also brushing up on cloud stuff with AWS (Iâ€™ve got a couple of certifications
            under my belt too). Docker, Kubernetes and DevOps in General are on my learning list next.
        </p>
        <p>
            Iâ€™ve built a few projects that Iâ€™m proud ofâ€”like a supermarket inventory management system, a CNN-based diabetic
            retinopathy detection model, a WhatsApp summarizer app and Two RESTful APIs. I like taking up challenges that mix real-world problems
            with tech.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of academics, Iâ€™m a mix of curious, adaptable, and quietly determined. Iâ€™m not the loudest in the room, but I
            get things done and like working with people who share the same energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short: coding, problem-solving, learning new tools, and always pushing myself to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Hobbies & Interests</b><br>
            When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll usually find me reading comics, trying out new games, Listening to J-pop,
            or exploring new tech tools just for fun. I also enjoy experimenting with small side projects
            and seeing how far I can push my ideas.
